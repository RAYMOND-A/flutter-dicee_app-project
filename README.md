# Dicee ðŸŽ²
Dicee is a Las Vegas dice app. 
You can make the die roll at the press of a button. 
With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!

## What i learnt from making this app

It introduced me to the core programming concepts like:
- How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- How to use Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
- How to change the properties of various widgets.
- How to use onPressed listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
- How to use setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
- How to use Expanded to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
- Understand and use string interpolation.
- Learn about basic dart programming concepts such as data types and functions.
- Code and use gesture controls.

Thanks to the App Brewery for their amazing course and of course to the Flutter teams for their great resources.
All these helped me complete the project.
